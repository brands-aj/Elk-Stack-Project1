# Elk-Stack-Project1
This is a collection of Linux and Ansible scripts, most of which were used to configure cloud servers with different docker containers. The final project includes four servers; two of which are running the DVWA containers, the third server is a jump box provisioner, and the fourth server is running the Elk Stack container.
